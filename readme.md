# Tip Calculator with JavaScript
The tip calculator is a beginner's friendly javaScript app that a user calculate tips based on the quality of service rendered and the number of people paying.
This app helps you exercise JavaScript features like
* JavaScript simple if-else stmt

No complicated setup is required as it's just a simple HTML, CSS and JavaScript app :wink:
